Church Encoded Numerals are way of representing integers in Lambda Calculus which is a framework to study computations based only on functions. Lambda Calculus is Turing complete and everything a Turing Machine is capable of doing can be represented using only functions. 
This is my implementation of Church Integers along with basic utility functions such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, If condition and finally using these utility functions I have implemented Factorial and Fibonnaci numbers.
